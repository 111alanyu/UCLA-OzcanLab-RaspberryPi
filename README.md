# User Interface for Handheld Biomarker Tracker 

## Install and Use 

To use, clone the repository then run the following command.
```bash
/bin/python path_to_folder/main.py -o output/path
```

For example you can run this: 
```bash
/bin/python /home/pi/Desktop/alan/main.py -o /home/pi/Desktop/Auionreduction
```

## Usage 
This creates a user interface with two main tabs:

1. Capture

2. Analysis 

### Capture 

In capture, you can create jpeg images (in regular light of the paper-based sensor) by clicking on "Control Capture".

You can also click "Start Capture" that takes in the parameters at the top and generates those images.

### Analysis 

In Analysis, you can either specify a path at the top OR use the images generated by capture (if you just ran it). 

You can first convert the .jpg images to .tiff images by clicking on "Convert Capture .jpg to .tiff". This will perserve the .jpg images.

Next you can click "Begin Analysis" that will mark the sensor with an overlay of circles.
